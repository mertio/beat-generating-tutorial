# Beat Generating Tutorial

This is a tutorial for generating beats from your own songs for the SideQuest game "Hit The Stars Unlimited". It is public and free for anyone to use. 

IMPORTANT: Before buying this game please make sure you can generate the beats for your songs using this tool. You should get an "output" file that has folders with the names of your songs and in these folders should be files such as:

-> songname (folder)
<br>
---> songname.mp3
<br>
---> drums_easy.txt
<br>
---> drums_medium.txt
<br>
---> drums_hard.txt
<br>
<br>
ONLY IF YOU MANAGE TO SUCCESSFULLY GET THESE FILES, SHOULD YOU BUY THIS GAME

## System Requirements

A computer that has at least 8 GB of RAM.

## For Windows

### Preparing The Music

Before starting, let's prepare the music we want to convert.

1) Create a folder and put the songs you want into it. I suggest only a few for your first try since it can take a long time.
2) They should all be mp3 files.
3) IMPORTANT: They should only contain English characters and not other alphabets like : ç, ü, ğ, ö, etc.
4) Name all your songs in a nice format like (band - songname.mp3) since they will be shown in the game that way.
5) I suggest your mp3 files should not exceed 6 MB each for RAM purposes.
