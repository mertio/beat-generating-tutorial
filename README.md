# Beat Generating Tutorial

This is a tutorial for generating beats from your own songs for the SideQuest game "Hit The Stars Unlimited". It is public and free for anyone to use. 
<br><br>
You should get an "output" file that has folders with the names of your songs and in these folders should be files such as:
<br><br>
-> songname (folder)
<br>
---> songname.mp3
<br>
---> drums_easy.txt
<br>
---> drums_medium.txt
<br>
---> drums_hard.txt
<br>

## System Requirements

- A computer that has at least 8 GB of RAM.
- 2 GB of hard disk space

### Preparing The Music

Before starting, let's prepare the music we want to convert.

1) Create a folder and put the songs you want into it. I suggest only a few for your first try since it can take a long time.
2) They should all be mp3 files.
3) IMPORTANT: They should only contain English characters and not other alphabets like : ç, ü, ğ, ö, etc.
4) Name all your songs in a nice format like (band - songname.mp3) since they will be shown in the game that way.
5) I suggest your mp3 files should not exceed 6 MB each for RAM purposes.

### Installing Docker

First we need to install Docker Desktop to our computer:

### Setting up enough RAM for Docker to use

After installing Docker, we need to assign at least 6 GB of RAM to it. This is because the AI needs a lot of RAM to generate the beats:
