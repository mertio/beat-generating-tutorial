# Beat Generating Tutorial

This is a tutorial for generating beats from your own songs for the SideQuest game "Hit The Stars Unlimited". It is public and free for anyone to use. 
<br><br>
You should get an "output" file that has folders with the names of your songs and in these folders should be files such as:
<br>
-> songname (folder)
<br>
---> songname.mp3
<br>
---> drums_easy.txt
<br>
---> drums_medium.txt
<br>
---> drums_hard.txt
<br>

## System Requirements

A computer that has at least 8 GB of RAM.

## For Windows

### Preparing The Music

Before starting, let's prepare the music we want to convert.

1) Create a folder and put the songs you want into it. I suggest only a few for your first try since it can take a long time.
2) They should all be mp3 files.
3) IMPORTANT: They should only contain English characters and not other alphabets like : ç, ü, ğ, ö, etc.
4) Name all your songs in a nice format like (band - songname.mp3) since they will be shown in the game that way.
5) I suggest your mp3 files should not exceed 6 MB each for RAM purposes.

### Installing Docker

First we need to install Docker Desktop for Windows in order to use our tool. Go to this link and click on "Get stable" to download the latest version:

### Setting up enough RAM for Docker to use

After installing Docker, we need to assign at least 6 GB of RAM to it. This is because the AI needs a lot of RAM to generate the beats.
