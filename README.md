### Preparing The Music

Before starting, let's prepare the music we want to convert.

1) Create a folder and put the songs you want into it. I suggest only a few for your first try since it can take a long time.
2) They should all be mp3 files.
3) IMPORTANT: They should only contain English characters and not other alphabets like : ç, ü, ğ, ö, etc.
4) Name all your songs in a nice format like (band - songname.mp3) since they will be shown in the game that way.
5) I suggest your mp3 files should not exceed 6 MB each for RAM purposes.
